# eAteliers - Home Task

eAteliers is on a mission to transform and digitize the wedding industry. We provide invaluable benefits to bridal brands by automating their daily processes, facilitating connections with potential partners, and allowing employees to focus on what's most important: the brides.

One of our latest features is a public catalog that brands can use for promotion, market sentiment analysis, and potential online sales.

## Requirements

For this task, you are required to create an attractive landing page to display these catalogs. We have prepared all the necessary boilerplate code using create-react-app with the typescript template, and TailwindCSS is already set up for styling.

You can access the catalog data for this task via the following endpoint:
`https://api.agnieszkaswiatly.com/v1/public/catalogues/e59e7e10-73dc-4d6a-b8ef-1260df3d6572`

This is a public endpoint and does not require authentication.

You have **two weeks to complete this task**.

Do not hesitate to **send us any questions** about the implementation or requirements.

## Evaluation

Your submission will be evaluated on the following criteria. While none are mandatory, the overall quality of the final work will be considered, and meeting more criteria will enhance your submission:
